# Lyric Scraping
### Webscraping and exporting lyrics to a csv file

### Purpose:
To get more experience webscraping (to gather data on my own rather than relying on Kaggle). Allows for more freedom in chosing a dataset of interest for future analysis. Data is present on various topics but not always in the format needed, being able to harvest it and produce it in a compact csv/other practical file is important for any data scientist.

### Future Plans
- Professor suggestion to do sentiment analysis on the lyrics gathered. 
- Find patterns in songs which make them popular/successful.
